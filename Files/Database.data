Garima Bhayana : remember that i am 20 years old. My favourite colour is admiral blue.Remeber when i say brave i mean brave browser.
Gia : I will remember that.
Garima Bhayana : Perform music click.
Gia : Let's get musical! What would you like to do? Would you like to explore a specific genre, find a new artist, or get recommendations based on your mood?
Garima Bhayana : Okay, bye.
Gia : It was nice chatting with you, Garima! Have a wonderful day!
Garima Bhayana : Hello how are you?
Gia : I'm doing great, thanks for asking, Garima! How about you?
Garima Bhayana : Form task mods type hello how are you?
Gia : Here is the formatted task:
**Task Mods**
**Hello, how are you?**
Garima Bhayana : Pata nahin usko kya bol rahe ho.
Gia : I think I can help with that! It seems like you're saying "Pata nahi usko kya bol rahe ho" which is Hindi for "I don't know what he's saying". Am I right, Garima?
Garima Bhayana : Can you do what i ask you to do?
Gia : I'll do my best to do exactly what you ask me to do, Garima!
Garima Bhayana : Form task not type hello.
Gia : **Task Mods**
Garima Bhayana : Hindi phone touch not like me.
Gia : It seems like you're saying that you don't like Hindi language support on your phone's touch interface. Is that correct, Garima?
Garima Bhayana : Bevkuf orientation chal raha tha use per.
Gia : I think I can understand! It seems like you're saying that the auto-rotation/orientation was not working properly on your phone, and it was being stupid (bevkoof). Is that right, Garima?
Garima Bhayana : Are bekar hai.
Gia : I think I get it! You're saying that something (maybe your phone or a particular feature) is useless (bekar).
Garima Bhayana : Safari.
Gia : You're talking about the Safari browser!
Garima Bhayana : On safari what is the hotkey command?
Gia : On Safari, the hotkey command to open a new tab is Command (âŒ˜) + T.
Garima Bhayana : Do word mein bhi samajh gai.
Gia : I think I can understand! You're saying that you also understand the concept in Brave (since you mentioned "do word" which I assume means "Brave" as per our earlier conversation). Is that correct, Garima?
Garima Bhayana : Are vah default safari per chal rahi hai na.
Gia : I think I get it! You're saying that Brave is currently set as the default browser instead of Safari, right?
Garima Bhayana : Jiya said brave browser as your default browser.
Gia : So Jiya told you to set Brave as your default browser.
Garima Bhayana : Yes set brave as your default browser.
Gia : Got it! I'll make sure to set Brave as the default browser.
